h1. Holler

A project inspired by 37signal's "In/Out":http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/976-a-peek-at-inout-an-internal-app-at-37signals and "Shout":http://davidsmalley.com/2008/4/21/shout-at-a-glance-status but with a few extra features.

Check out the "Holler demo":http://www.hollerapp.com

h2. Install

"Get Holler":http://github.com/zachinglis/holler/tree/master.  Once you've got the application extracted, you can run rake setup:app to get started quickly. You may also want to edit settings.rb and change the ADMIN_EMAIL.
